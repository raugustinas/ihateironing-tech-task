Thank you for the task!

I'm not sure if I had to follow the designs from the task doc so I didn't focus on the UI and made it pretty simple.
Also, I locked the screen orientation to portrait to save some time.
Please inform me if the UI needs to be similar to the screenshots or it has to support landscape orientation and I'll spend some more time on that.
I hope I haven't missed anything and I'm really looking forward to the feedback!
